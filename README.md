## Building Obsidian-QT
### Ubuntu
To install dependencies and build Obsidian-QT under Ubuntu,
open a terminal and then do the following:


clone the github repository
```
git clone https://github.com/obsidianplatform/Obsidian-Qt
```
move into Obsidian-Qt folder
```
cd Obsidian-Qt
```
run buildscript to build binaries,
when asked for a RPC-User and a RPC-Password,
choose a username and a secure password,
enter them and press **Enter**

```
./new-build.sh
```
This generates a folder called *bin* where the newly buit binaries for
*Obsidian-Qt* and *obsidiand* can be found.

#### Statically linked builds
Statically linked builds are prefered when the binary should
be executable on other GNU/Linux systems.
To build the binaries statically, just call the *new-build.sh*
with the *--static* parameter.
```
./new-build.sh --static
```
This builds the *Obsidian-QT* as well as *obsidiand* binaries staticaly.
